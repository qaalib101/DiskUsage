Disk Usage

This program gets the main directory and displays its used and free parts using the Google Chart visualization API.

The program also lets the user choose a folder on the computer. Then it provides data in the form of charts or graphs for the data.
The bar graph shows the top ten files(if the directory has lower than it show those). The pie graph shows the file types in the directory.
And the line graph shows the files modified by date. You can scroll between either day, month, year.

You will need node.js, npm for packages.
